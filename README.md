### My general projects

If you dive into my profile is possible to see some projects named with an "`FL`". Those are my personal projects that I'm trying to give more attention beyond only studying and coding experiments. As a brief resume of then, we have:

- `FLBinary`: my own custom project to work with bytes writing and reading from scratch in low level (Kotlin);
- `FLListening`: my own custom abstraction to get reusability on patterns `observer` and `event-driven` (Kotlin);
- `FLTimer`: my custom project of timer/chronometer for speedcubing. This aims to have a lot of another tools beyond only timming (Kotlin/Mobile);
- `FLHexrray`: my personal implementation to work with small arrays as hexadecimal numbers (Kotlin);
- `FLEngine`: my first (old/deprecated?) project of graphics engine/framework (Kotlin);
- `FLMidi`: project used to extract information from binary files of format MIDI (_.mid_ extension) (Kotlin);
- `FLArcheology`: my custom project to work with the Runescape3 Archeology skill data. Should be turned into an frea access API in the future (Kotlin/Binary?/Protobuf?/JSON).

There's also `FLLolClientUI-Clone`, `FLYoutubeExtractor`, `FLOrganizer`, `FLConsumer` that are projects in a huge early development phase. They should be updated or removed in the future.

### My general projects

If you dive into my profile is possible to see some projects named with an "`FL`". Those are my personal projects that I'm trying to give more attention beyond only studying and coding experiments. As a brief resume of then, we have:

- [`FL-Refs`](https://github.com/LucasAlfare/FL-Refs): my own backend system to manage images of reference sheet style (for drawing/3D modeling/sculpting);
- [`FLTimer`](https://github.com/LucasAlfare/FLTimer/tree/view_modeling): my custom project of timer/chronometer for speedcubing. This aims to have a lot of another tools beyond only timming (Desktop/Mobile);
- [`FLMidi`](https://github.com/LucasAlfare/FLEngine): project used to extract information from binary files of sound format MIDI (_.mid_ extension) (Kotlin);
- [`FLArcheology`](https://github.com/LucasAlfare/FLArcheology): my custom project to work with the MMORPG Runescape3 Archeology skill data. Should be turned into an free access API in the future (Kotlin/Binary?/Protobuf?/JSON).

There's also other, such as `FLLolClientUI-Clone`, `FLYoutubeExtractor`, `FLOrganizer`, `FLConsumer` that are projects in a huge early development phase. They should be updated or removed in the future.
